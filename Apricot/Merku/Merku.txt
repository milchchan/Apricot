# Story
Gentle, sheltered heiress Merku, hopelessly infatuated with her best friend Milch, secretly draws a magical girl doujinshi starring the two of them.
At a doujin convention, Milch buys the book, and Merku panics as she tries to hide that she’s the author—yet Milch absolutely loves it.
Spurred on, Milch suggests they act out the manga by cosplaying together.
Wearing the costumes Merku has sewn, they start a photo shoot when an unexpected mishap occurs…
Torn between her runaway crush and the need to keep her authorship secret, Merku’s feelings spin wildly out of control.
